* Units
    * __Units of Length.__ Meter, Kilometer, Centimeter, Millimeter, Inch, Thousandth of an Inch, Foot, Yard or Mile.
    * __Units of Angle.__ Radian, Degree, or Revolution.
    * __Stiffness.__ Newton per meter, Newton per Millimeter, Kilonewton per meter, Kilonewton per millimeter, Pound force per inch, Pound force per foot, Kilogram-force per meter, or Kilogram-force per millimeter.
    * __Force.__  Newton, Kilonewton, Pound force, or Kilogram Force.
    * __Torque.__ Newton-meter, Newton-millimeter, Newton-centimeter, Kilonewton-meter, Foot pound-force, Inch pound-force, or Kilogram-force meter.
* Referential
    * __Longitudinal Axis.__ You may define this axis to either be the X, Y, or Z and which direction you would prefer to be positive.
    * __Lateral Axis.__ You may define this axis to either be the X, Y, or Z and which direction you would prefer to be positive.
    * __Vertical Axis.__ You may define this axis to either be the X, Y, or Z and which direction you would prefer to be positive.
* Motion Steps
    * User has the option to override the Number of Steps for a given simulation. The default value is 20 steps.
* Roll/Pitch Axes
    * Moving Axis.
    * Fixed Axis on the Ground.
    * User-Defined Fixed Axis.
* Display
    * Here the user can change the default colors used to associate the following:
      * Background Color
      * Roll Center
      * Roll Axis
      * Pitch Center
