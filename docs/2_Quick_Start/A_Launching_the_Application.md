# Graphical User Interface

When opening the software, the first thing you see is the <span style="color:mediumpurple"> __Backstage__ </span>. Here, you can manage your projects and adjust [Licensing](../1_Introduction/A) and projects [Options Menu](../2_Quick_Start/B_OptionsMenu.md).

Once you create a project, you automatically leave the <span style="color:mediumpurple"> __Backstage__ </span> and enter the Main GUI. In the Main GUI:

* The top is the <span style="color:green"> __Ribbon Control Bar__ </span> with all shortcuts to functionalities of the software.
* The center is the <span style="color:orange"> __Document Manager__ </span> where you may edit project files.
* The left contains the <span style="color:deepskyblue"> __Project Tree__ </span>, which allows you to organize project files.

The <span style="color:green"> __Ribbon Control Bar__ </span> contains all the buttons that help you interact with the application.

The <span style="color:orange"> __Document Manager__ </span> allows the user to have multiple tabbed documents openned at the same time. The tabs can be dragged and dropped to be displayed side by side, or in any other configuration on the same screen. Also, the user performs any design, simulation, or analysis functionality here. In the Options Menu, it is possible to change the color of these tabs to aid in keeping things organized.

The <span style="color:deepskyblue"> __Project Tree__ </span> allows you to manage all aspects of your project. Vehicles can be added and organized into differing subfolders, likewise with the suspensions, setups, forces, and motions in the project.

# Creating a New Project

The first step is to create a new project. To do this, click the __New Project__ button under the file tab. You are then asked to select a name and a directory for your project.

Upon creating a new project, the software creates a folder on your hard drive in the selected directory. This directory is used to save all the files related to your project. The different files that you may find are:

|Name|Extension|Icon|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Project File      |.O2Pro|![ProjectFileIcon](../img/Quick_Start/Table1-Line1-ProjectFileIcon.png)|
|Suspension File   |.O2Sus|![SuspensionFileIcon](../img/Quick_Start/Table1-Line2-SuspensionFileIcon.png)|
|Vehicle Setup File|.O2Set|![VehicleSetupFileIcon](../img/Quick_Start/Table1-Line3-VehicleSetupFileIcon.png)|
|Motion File       |.O2Mot|![MotionFileIcon](../img/Quick_Start/Table1-Line4-MotionFileIcon.png)|
|Force File        |.O2For|![ForceFileIcon](../img/Quick_Start/Table1-Line5-ForceFileIcon.png)|

# Opening an Existing Project
When it comes time to open an existing project, you must know the location of the directory in which the project files are. Within the folder, you should find the OptimumKinematics Project File (.O2Pro). To open the project, click on the “Open” button in the <span style="color:mediumpurple"> __Backstage__ </span> so the “Open Project” dialog box opens. In the dialog box, navigate to your project’s folder and select the OptimumKinematics Project File (.O2Pro). Click “Open” to open the project.

# Saving a Project
The project can be saved using the __Save__ button in the <span style="color:mediumpurple"> __Backstage__ </span> ([Graphical User Interface](#graphical-user-interface), under File) or using the shortcut (Ctrl + S). The project can be saved to another location using the __Save As__ button in the Backstage or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + S).

When closing the application, the application asks if you want to save the project, if you have not already.
