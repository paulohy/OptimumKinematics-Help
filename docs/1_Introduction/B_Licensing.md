OptimumKinematics uses two different licenses for the standard software and the Forces Module add-on.  The OptimumKinematics software license can be purchased yearly through our [website](http://www.optimumg.com/software/purchase-a-software-subscription-plan/).

The Forces Module is an additional module which you may purchase on our website for an additional yearly fee.  The Forces Module adds the ability to apply forces in each corner of the car and calculate the force at each pickup point of the suspension.

To apply the licenses for OptimumKinematics:

* Activation. In the <span style="color:mediumpurple"> __Backstage__ </span> ([Graphical User Interface](../2_Quick_Start/A_Launching_the_Application.md#Graphical-User-Interface), Under File) select __License__ and then Apply Key. You enter with the Key, your Name, and E-Mail address.  There are separate options to enter the main license and the Forces Module license.
* Deactivation. You must deactivate a key to use it on another computer. To perform a key deactivation, go to __License__ at the <span style="color:mediumpurple"> __Backstage__ </span>.  You can either deactivate the license manually or choose the ‘Deactivate on Closing’ option.

In the case that an internet connection is not available for periodic activation, the user has a small grace period to ensure that they do not lose access to OptimumKinematics.
